# Topic: cost efficiency

Questions

Aircraft costs when training:
    1. Datasets:
      1. Cost of Parts, Repair, and Overhaul per Hour of Flight on Selected Aircraft 2006-2016 (STATIC)
      2. Fuel costs for each aircraft in the above dataset from bwifly (DYNAMIC depending on market)
      3. Weather (DYNAMIC)
    2. Sub-questions:
      1. Costs of repair vs weather -> exercises (which exercises to do accounting for the weather)

What defines success and failure? (For PPL)

He will get back to us in terms of success or failure
    
Time of the year (season/month) that has the most success?
Will depend on above and does it have a bias?

Time of the year (month/season) with the most demand?
Count for every month/season. This can represented graphically using a barchart

Type of aircraft that minimizes cost:
cost function
variables for the cost: weather 
constraints in terms of demand and sessions
cost is variable for each month/season and for each aircraft so can we figure out


Graphs:
1. Demand:
    1. General barchart for all the data we have
    2. Barchart average of each month x2 (non covid vs covid)
    3. Barchart average of each season x2 (non covid vs covid)
    4. barchart for plane
2. Cost:
    1. Barchart for static cost per model
    2. Fuel cost over time per model
    3. weather cost over time per model

Minimize number of sessions by picking the best exercises that do so
Type of aircraft that maximizes successful training? Bias: student can choose which plane model

General:

today:
- go over everything to ensure that what we are doing makes sense, check the company websites and instructions
- get the data and format it

tom:
- weather data 
- combine and write up

Todos:
1. pre-process the data to remove typos, e.g. exercises 24 and 40 and make sure it is in tidy format - wesley / moh
2. barcharts for demand - jason / moh
3. webscraping to get data: cost of repairs, parts and overhaul for each aircraft model each year, fuel costs for each model (how many gallons it burns per hour + fuel it burns + cost of that fuel vs time from 2016-2020) - adham
4. webscraping for + research: weather costs for the aircraft - possibly adham (tom)
5. write up of all the ideas - (tom)
